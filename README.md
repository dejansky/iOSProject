Allows the user to create/edit and view the events created. 
Build in Xcode 12 

Application description:

The purpose of this project is to create an application for the Appleâ€™s mobile devices such as iPhones and iPads. The application is created and developed using various development tools, such as X-code as the IDE and GitHub for version control of the code. Swift is used as the main programming language to develop this application.  
The application is intended to function as a simple calendar/planner where the user can create events and add date and time for every event. For each event there is a text field which the user fills to describe the event. Every time an event is created, the date in which the event takes place is marked on the calendar. This makes it easier for the user to, from the start page, see the dates in which there is an event and edit the event.  If the user selects a date for which there is an event, the application allows the user to edit description, time and date for that event. The application does not notify the user when an event is occurring.
